   Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the required environment variables. Ensure to update the following variables specific to Clerk and Convex:

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   # Update .env.local with the necessary variables, including CLERK_HOSTNAME and CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET for Clerk integration.
   ```

3. **Create Webhook from Clerk**:

   - Log in to your Clerk dashboard and create a webhook for integration. Update the `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable with the generated webhook secret, and update convex environment from setting and add `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` `CLERK_HOSTNAME`

4. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Production Mode

### Requirements

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)

### Steps to Run in Production

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Start the Containers**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   - The `docker-compose up -d` command runs the containers in detached mode, allowing them to run in the background.

3. **Stopping the Containers**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

   - The `docker-compose down` command stops and removes the containers, networks, and volumes created by `up`.

### Explanation of Commands

- `docker-compose build`: Builds the Docker images defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- `docker-compose up -d`: Starts the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file in detached mode.
- `docker-compose down`: Stops and removes the services, networks, and volumes defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
